# FYCELE

This is a Build of FYC that is a desktop app this dose not come with the FYC source code you need to download that your self as I will get banned for uploading it but once you get it extract it and open the folder FYC and drag all the code in there this is how the ls should look:

    httpanimatins@pop-os:~/Code/FYCELE/FYC$ ls
    APIServer.py    ExtraCode           index.html      Templates
    Audio          'FYCREWirte Code'   MovieStreamer  'With Credit Protogen.png'
    BetaSeverCode  'FYC Rewrite.ico'   Server.py
    httpanimatins@pop-os:~/Code/FYCELE/FYC$ 

if you don't have it setup it will show a white screnn pls make sure not use a old version of FYC as it will cause issues with keybinds and will cause api issues
